These are the scripts used to perform the "RF with balanced sampling" and "RF without balanced sampling" tests for genome-wide off-target profile prediction. 

The original testing data can be referred in "Shiran Abadi et al., A machine learning approach for predicting CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage efficiencies and patterns underlying its mechanism of action. PLoS Comput Biology. 2017;10(13):e1005807."
